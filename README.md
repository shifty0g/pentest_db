# Pentest Database

This is just a spreadsheet with useful commands in that can be quickly searched for using filters.

I use this on a daily basis when testing. 

I have included a basic bash script making it searchable using fzf. I plan to make this better down the line

I am still building this and trying to get some order to it so it is a bit messy.

Some commands are collected from various sources so thank you for sharing 


The main idea is my memory is poor and being half asleep sitting on the floor in a DC your gonna make mistakes so to get things done quick and get out I started to make this so i can copy pasta ez mode. 


Not sure where this is going but im happy for feedback,. suggestions and things to add. I want to build this into something useful


This is a work in progress which i build up as i go. its not perfect but i like it. I am trying tto tidy this up and will add more. be paitent.

I am looking for help with this so please ge tin touch



## Install

```bash

cd pentest_db
chmod +x pentest_db.sh 
source pentest_db.sh

# add the source entry to .zshrc or .bashrc

# .zshrc
echo "source $(realpath /my_scripts/github/pentest_db/pentest_db.sh)" >> ~/.zshrc

# OR 

# .bashrc 
echo "source $(realpath /my_scripts/github/pentest_db/pentest_db.sh)" >> ~/.bashrc

# Install the prerequisites using the function 
commands-install

# You should be all setup and ready to go now 
```



## Useage

An example of using this is when enumerating a target which you found has FTP open (21 TCP). You open up **datbase.xlsx** filter the service by `FTP` and boom you have the commands you need to attack the port.

you could also use the bash script if its soruced the `commands` command that will pull up **fzf** which can be used to search.

Variables are used to allow copy and paste - i am still working them out 


set the variable (realpath helps with pathing stuff)

```bash
export IP="192.168.2.22"
export IPFILE=$(realpath targets.txt)
export URL="https://bbc.co.uk"
export URLFILE="$(realpath urls.txt)"
export PASS="5ecret123"
export PASSFILE="$(/wordlists/pass.txt)"
export USER="Admin"
export USERFILE="$(realpath /wordlists/users.txt)"
export WORDLIST="$(realpath /wordlists/rockyou.txt)"
```

paste in the command and make adjustments then execute 

Im trying to improve and clean this up when i can but im lazy 

## Future 

I want to make a powershell script too to search - cover all basis.

I wanto add a bucketload of commands
