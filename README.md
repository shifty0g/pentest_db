# Pentest Database

This is just a spreadsheet with useful commands in that can be quickly searched for using filters.
I have included a bash script to make it grep-able in linux. I plan to make this better down the line
I am still building this and trying to get some order to it so it is a bit messy.
Some commands are collected from various sources which i will try to thank and link to them below. I just copied them into a spreadsheet


The main idea is my memory is poor and being half asleep sitting on the floor in a DC your gonna make mistakes so to get things done quick and get out I started to make this so i can copy pasta ez mode. This grew and grew so i am sharing it no here 


Not sure where this is going but im happy for feedback,. suggestions and things to add. I want to build this into something useful
