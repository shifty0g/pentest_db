# Pentest Database

This is just a spreadsheet with useful commands in that can be quickly searched for using filters.
I use this on a daily bases pentesting. 
I have included a basic bash script to make it grep-able in linux. I plan to make this better down the line
I am still building this and trying to get some order to it so it is a bit messy.
Some commands are collected from various sources so thank you for sharing 


The main idea is my memory is poor and being half asleep sitting on the floor in a DC your gonna make mistakes so to get things done quick and get out I started to make this so i can copy pasta ez mode. This grew and grew so i am sharing it no here 


Not sure where this is going but im happy for feedback,. suggestions and things to add. I want to build this into something useful

#### Useage
